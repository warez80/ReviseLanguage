# ReviseLanguage

This is a mock assembly language that I worked on sometimes when I was bored in high school. It includes an assembler and it pipes program source through the C preprocessor to allow for preprocessor macros.

The CPU is mostly based off of the original Gameboy CPU which is a Z80 processor. I added instructions whenever I felt like it and my goal was to make a language that encouraged the use of self-modifying code and generally weird behavior.
